# Summary of Fixes for Constellation App

This document provides a concise summary of all the fixes implemented for the Constellation app to address issues with profile saving, message sending, image sharing, and sign-out functionality.

## Database Structure Fixes

### 1. Profiles Table
- Added missing columns: `star_name`, `star_type`, `about`, `interests`, `avatar_url`, `photo_url`
- Migrated data from incorrectly named columns (e.g., `starName` to `star_name`)
- Ensured consistency between `avatar_url` and `photo_url` fields

### 2. SQL Functions
- Fixed `update_profile` function to handle both `avatar_url` and `photo_url` fields
- Created `get_profile` function to retrieve authenticated user's profile
- Created `get_partner_profile` function to retrieve partner's profile in a constellation
- Fixed ambiguous column references in `get_constellation_messages` function
- Enhanced `send_message` function with proper error handling
- Created `increase_bonding_strength` function to update constellation bonding

### 3. Row Level Security (RLS)
- Enabled RLS for the profiles table
- Created policies to ensure users can only view and update their own profiles
- Created policy to allow users to view profiles within their constellation

### 4. Real-time Publication
- Ensured the `supabase_realtime` publication exists
- Added both `messages` and `profiles` tables to the publication for real-time updates

## Storage Bucket Fixes

### 1. Bucket Creation and Naming
- Created helper functions for bucket and policy management
- Ensured the `chat_images` bucket exists (renamed from `chat-images` if necessary)
- Set appropriate bucket settings (private access)

### 2. Bucket Policies
- Created policies to allow authenticated users to view images in their constellations
- Created policies to allow authenticated users to upload images to their constellations
- Added a fallback policy for debugging purposes

## Client-Side Fixes

### 1. Image Upload
- Implemented multiple fallback mechanisms for image uploads
- Added bucket existence check before upload
- Improved error handling with user-friendly messages
- Added support for different file paths on iOS and Android

### 2. Message Sending
- Improved error handling during message sending
- Added proper handling of image attachments
- Implemented fallback mechanisms when RPC calls fail

### 3. Profile Photo Saving
- Ensured consistent handling of `avatar_url` and `photo_url` fields
- Added proper error handling during profile updates
- Improved user feedback during the update process

### 4. Sign-Out Functionality
- Added loading state during sign-out
- Implemented error handling for sign-out failures
- Added user feedback through alerts

## Implementation Files

1. **fix_database_structure.sql**: Comprehensive script to fix all database structure issues
2. **fix_storage_bucket.sql**: Script to fix storage bucket naming and policies
3. **fix_profile_functionality.sql**: Script focused specifically on profile-related functionality
4. **IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md**: Step-by-step guide for implementing all fixes
